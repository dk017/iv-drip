* All phone numbers use `tel:`; add `rel="nofollow noopener"` on external links.  

▶️ SEO & OG  
* Title: “Posh IV Hydration Services | Mobile Drip Therapy Denver”  
* Meta description: “Registered nurses bring vitamin-rich IV drips to your home, hotel or office in Denver. Book now — feel revitalized in 45 minutes.”  
* OpenGraph + Twitter Card tags (use hero image placeholder `/assets/hero.jpg`).  

▶️ CODE QUALITY  
* Semantic HTML5 sections, aria-labels on nav and accordion.  
* Tailwind utility classes only; no inline `<style>`.  
* Put all JS in `/assets/app.js`; debounce scroll; keep under 80 lines.  
* Comment TODO markers where client-specific edits may be required.
